This new k table is made from HITRAN 2000 data base to reduce the total number of subbands over the solar spectrum.
The total number of ks with this new tables is significantly smaller than the original tables.
The reason for the reduction is new treatment of overlapping bands.
Instead of applying the multiplicative rule, water vapor is set to the major constituent and the other gas is set to minor constituents.
The concentration of minor gases are fixed to the mean mixing ration in the following table.

1) Major and Minor gases 

Band No.      Major      Minor      Number of subbands
12            H2O         -            6
14            H2O         -            5
16            H2O        O2            6
17            H2O         -            6
19            H2O         -            6
20            H2O         -            6
21            H2O         -            7
22            H2O         -            6
23            H2O         -            7
24            H2O         -            8
25            H2O        CO2          11
27            H2O        CO2           6
28            H2O         -            7
29            H2O        CO2           9
30            H2O        O3            7
31            H2O        CO2           7
32            H2O        CO2          15

The format of the table is exactly the same as before. 
Since the new tables include H2O in all bands, all bands use pressure, temperature and water vapor concentration coordinate.
 

2) Mixing ratio of minor gases.
Mixing ratio of minor gases are fixed when these tables are made from 
LBLRTM (Clough et al. 1992, J. Geophys, Res., 97 15761-15785).
The profile of the CO2 mixing ratio used in generating these tables is

The oxygen mixing ratio is fixed to 0.20946E+06 ppmv.

3) Format of tables.

Tables are given in three different formats, NetCDF, binary and ascii formats.
Writing statement used to write the binary file is

    npts = nx*ny*nz*maxngauss ;
    fwrite(&gauabx[0],   sizeof(double),   npts, fptrb);

where
nx (pressure)                  = 17
ny (temperature)               = 11
nz (water vapor concentration) = 13
and
maxngauss is the number of Gaussian quadratures (number of subbands), which depend on band.

gauabx is the cross section per molecule in cm^2.
For overlapping bands, the absorption coefficients of all gases are divided by 
the concentration of water vapor so that when cross section is multiplied by 
the concentration of water vapor, it gives the absorption coefficient combining 
both water vapor and minor gas.
Binary files are made by a Unix (sun) system.

Ascii format is
first row
band number, number of Gaussian quadratures, Gaussian weights
second row to the end of the file
index of pressure coordinate, index of temperature coordinate, 
index of water vapor coordinate, absorption cross section in 
cm^2.
 
The pressure, temperature and water vapor coordinates are:
pressure (hPa)
1050.0 834.0 662.0 526.0 418.0 332.0 264.0 168.0 106.0  66.9  42.2 26.6  16.8  10.6   1.0   0.1  0.01

Temperature (K)
120.0 140.0 160.0 180.0 200.0 220.0 240.0 260.0 280.0 300.0 320.0

water vapor concentration (m^-3)
0.15e26 0.47e25 0.15e25  0.47e24  0.15e24  0.47e23  0.15e23  0.47e22  0.15e22  0.47e21  0.15e21  0.47e20  0.15e20

Not all combinations are filled by absorption cross sections because some combinations are not
realistic to the atmosphere of the earth.


4) Comparison with old tables.
The new tables give slightly less absorption compared with old table as shown by the attached table.
