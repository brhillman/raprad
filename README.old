RAPRAD is the version where I have made some modifications so that the model can work with Linux system,
such as changing the binary files and a few other things.

The ORIGINAL is the original package that I received from Tom.

Raprad-8 is the version before the computer was upgraded on 15 Sept 2008.

On 15 Sept 2008 the RAPRAD version has some problems to run after the operating system is upgraded. This is
because a lot of variables in the code were used but never been defined.

I'm working on fixing this problem on the Raprad-9 version:

Long wave
1. Fix 'iopen' used but not defined in 'rt.raprad/2stream/src/raprad.2stream.lw.driver.f'
2. Delete the computation of solar radiation in 'rt.raprad/2stream/src/raprad.2stream.lw.add.f'
3. 'du0' in 'rt.raprad/2stream/src/raprad.2stream.lw.add.f' is not defined, but it not really needed anyway.
4. 'wx_3' in 'util/src/rrtm_driver_setcoef_taumol.f' is used for a 'write' statement but is not defined.
5. put a write statement in 'rt.raprad/2stream/src/raprad.2stream.lw.driver.f' to print out optical depth.
   This seems to fix the problem that 'taul' is NaN when it is passed on to the subroutine 'oppr1'.
   No idea why this would fix the problem.
6. Modify 'util/src/setcoef.f' to make it less confusing: check 'istart'
7. declare 'void' for the routine 'atmosphere_layers'
8. declare 'void' for the routine 'check_spectralmodel_kato'
9. declare 'void' for the routine 'spectralmodel_read_mlawer_lw'

1. declare 'void' for the routine 'read_brdf_selection'
2. declare 'void' for the routine 'spectralmodel_read_kato'
3. declare 'void' for the routine 'spectralmodel_read_pollack'
4. declare 'void' for the routine 'check_spectralmodel_pollack'
5. declare 'void' for the routine 'cntnmmodel_read'
6. declare 'void' for the routine 'check_cntnmmodel'
7. declare 'void' for the routine 'check_atmosphere_layers_lw'
8. declare 'void' for the routine 'checkentry'
9. comment 'readentries' which isn't used anywhere


1. declare 'void' for the routine 'check_geometry_sunzenith'


Short wave
1. Delete 'tmi' in '2stream/src/raprad.2stream.sw.add.f' that uses 'u1i' that is not defined.
   'tmi' is not used anywhere anyway.
