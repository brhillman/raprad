/* properties change as a function of wavelength which complicates */

/* getting this information into the simulation.  Either you       */
/* specify the wavelength dependence of the particles' properties  */
/* explicity in this file or you put in a -1 flag and have these   */
/* properities determined elsewhere in the code either using       */
/* the appropriate phase function file input or explicity          */
/* calculating them in some routine that calculates the particle   */
/* extinction properties as a function of wavelength and layer.    */
/* For this latter case, the constituent number densities must be  */
/* specified either in this file or the atmospheric input file.    */ 
/* If you do not specify a -1, then the optical depths and single  */
/* scatter albedos must be specified for each band in a list whose */
/* number of members equals the number of channels                 */
/* pp->numintervals chosen in the photon partition configuration.  */
/* In any case, the phase function file for any scattering         */
/* constituent must contain exactly pp->numintervals entries, one  */
/* for each channel or spectral band used in the computation.      */
/* Any cloud properties must come before all other constituent     */
/* properties.  This is so because the water vapor density in the  */
/* cloud must be considered when computing the gaseous absorption  */
/* in the region of the cloud.                                     */
