Comments about the original Kato spectral model label notation:

	modtran3_sun:

		Solar insolation from Modtran 3

	wmo_kato_o3xsection:

		The original ozone cross sections were developed by Clothiaux
		from WMO data.  Kato recomputed the cross sections from the same
		data set and came up with slightly different numbers.

	all_H2O:

		Kato included water vapor absorption into bands which contain
		some weak water vapor absorption that had been neglected in the
		original model.

	modtran3_o3xsection:

		Ozone cross sections come from work by Eric P. Shettle.
		These are the ozone cross sections used in Modtran 3.

	4sgp_mfrsr:

		A kluge in order to compute irradiances at the MFRSR
		wavelengths.  The solar constant is given by the Langley
		Io value developed by Kato.  The wavelengths, too, match
		the instrument wavelengths.  All gaseous absorption is
		neglected, excepth that due to ozone.  The wavelengths
		other than the instrument wavelengths do not contain any
		useful information

	4sgp_mfr:

		The same as 4sgp_mfrsr, except for the MFRSR instrument
		with no rotating shadow band that was used during the
		Spring 1997 aircraft IOP.
