Comments about the original Kato spectral model label notation:

	modtran3_sun:

		Solar insolation from Modtran 3

	wmo_kato_o3xsection:

		The original ozone cross sections were developed by Clothiaux
		from WMO data.  Kato recomputed the cross sections from the same
		data set and came up with slightly different numbers.

	all_H2O:

		Kato included water vapor absorption into bands which contain
		some weak water vapor absorption that had been neglected in the
		original model.

	modtran3_o3xsection:

		Ozone cross sections come from work by Eric P. Shettle.
		These are the ozone cross sections used in Modtran 3.


	combine_overlap
		CO2 concentration is fixed relative to water vapor to reduce the number of 
		subbands.

	fu_kato
		use bands of the fu-liou code

	hitran2k
		k distributions obtained from HITRAN 2000 data base.

Comments about the phase function input files

Each data line corresponds to a wavelength band. In each line:
1.  wavelength: wavelength at the centre of the band (micro-metre)
2.  radiusout
3.  radiussig
4.  relrefoutr
5.  relrefoutc
6.  p_legendre_number: NUMBER OF LEGENDRE POLYNOMIALS IN THE PHASE FUNCTION
7.  p_g: ASYMMETRY PARAMETER
8.  w0: SINGLE SCATTERING ALBEDO
9.  sig_ext: TOTAL EXTINCTION CROSS-SECTION (micron^2)
10. sig_sca: TOTAL SCATTERING CROSS-SECTION (micron^2)
11. sig_abs:  TOTAL ABSORPTION CROSS-SECTION (micron^2)
12. p_normalization

As far as I can see the first five numbers in this input file are read in but are not used anywhere in the program. The wavelengths should be the same as in the photonpartition file contained in rt.raprad/scenarios/bbflux/st_atm_lw or st_atm.
These inputs for the phase functions are read by the file /rt.raprad_package/rt.raprad/util/src/phasefcns.read.ascii.c
