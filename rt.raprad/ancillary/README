Comments about the original Kato spectral model label notation:

	modtran3_sun:

		Solar insolation from Modtran 3

	wmo_kato_o3xsection:

		The original ozone cross sections were developed by Clothiaux
		from WMO data.  Kato recomputed the cross sections from the same
		data set and came up with slightly different numbers.

	all_H2O:

		Kato included water vapor absorption into bands which contain
		some weak water vapor absorption that had been neglected in the
		original model.

	modtran3_o3xsection:

		Ozone cross sections come from work by Eric P. Shettle.
		These are the ozone cross sections used in Modtran 3.


	combine_overlap
		CO2 concentration is fixed relative to water vapor to reduce the number of 
		subbands.

	fu_kato
		use bands of the fu-liou code

	hitran2k
		k distributions obtained from HITRAN 2000 data base.
