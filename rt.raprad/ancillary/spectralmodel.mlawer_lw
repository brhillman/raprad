SPECTRAL MODEL MLAWER_LW (Correlated-k)

The model has 16 spectral intervals with gaseous absorptionin in all of the intervals.
Absorption is treated using the correlated-k technique on HI-TRAN database coefficients
that are a function of pressure and temperature.  The water vapor coefficients are also
a function of the water vapor concentration.  The transmission is given by

T = Sum_{i=1}^{Number of Quadrature Points} quadrature_weights(i) * exp(-xsections(i)*Nmolecules)

where Nmolecules is the gas column amount in units of cm amagats for Ozone and # m^{-3}
for the other gases.  Note that 1 cm amagat is cross section (cm^2) times Loschmidt's
number = No = 2.687e+19 cm^{-03}.  The quadrature_weights(i) and xsections(i) are the
weights (dimensionless) and absorption coefficients (1/cm-atm for Ozone and cm^2/molecule
for the other gases), respectively, for each interval.  For bands with absorption by
multiple gases, we assume that the gaseous absorption is independent and the total
transmission is then given by

T = Tgas1 * Tgas2 * Etc

The temperature, pressure and water vapor concentration grids are:
